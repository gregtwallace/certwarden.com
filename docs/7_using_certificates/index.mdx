# Using Certificates

There are multiple options to use certificates once they're issued. API Calls
are the original option and involve a basic authenticated api call.

Cert Warden now also supports running a script or binary on the server
as a post-processing function. This allows easy update of remote clients
that may not be able to run a script locally (e.g. a Dell idrac, switch,
etc.).

A Cert Warden Client is also available as a Docker container which runs
on a client machine and manages fethcing certificates from the Cert Warden
instance.
