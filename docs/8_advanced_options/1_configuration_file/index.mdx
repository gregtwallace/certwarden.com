# Configuration File

Cert Warden uses a single configuration file: `./data/app/config.yaml`. This file 
can be manually edited but you most likely will not need to do so.

:::warning
You can have a perfectly functional Cert Warden Server without ever editing this 
file manually. Only do so if you review the documentation and determine 
you need to.
:::

Config file documentation is included with both the Docker and binary 
file distributions. Rather than try and keep this documentation in sync 
with those, here are the links:

- [`config.example.yaml`](https://github.com/gregtwallace/certwarden-backend/blob/master/config.example.yaml): 
  Documentation of available options and what they do.
- [`config.default.yaml`](https://github.com/gregtwallace/certwarden-backend/blob/master/config.default.yaml):
  Default values for the config options if not specified.
- [`config.changelog.md`](https://github.com/gregtwallace/certwarden-backend/blob/master/config.changelog.md):
  Change log of config options across Cert Warden and config schema versions.

These are the most recent master branch versions. You should refer to 
the versions bundled with your release for complete accuracy.
