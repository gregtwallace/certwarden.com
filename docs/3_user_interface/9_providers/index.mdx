# Providers (Challenge Solvers)

Providers AKA Challenge Solvers are how you prove to the ACME Server that you 
actually control the domain(s) you're requesting certificates for.

There are two main methods to accomplish this. One is http-01 and the other is 
dns-01.

The `Providers` page shows all current providers. It also allows adding, 
editing, and deleting of providers.

## Challenge Types

### http-01

The http-01 method works by running an http server that provides a specfic 
reply to the ACME Server when it reaches out to the http server. The 
http response MUST be provided by the domain name you're requesting a 
certificate for and it must be served from internet facing port 80.

This tends to prove challenging for a number of reasons so 
most people use the dns-01 method instead. If you do want to use http-01, Cert Warden
provides a built-in http server specifically for this purpose.

This method does NOT support wildcards.

### dns-01

The dns-01 method works by provisioning a dns TXT record that the ACME Server
checks for. Since no internet facing http service is required, this tends to 
be the preferred method, though it does have its own risks such as usually 
requiring API keys capable of adding and deleting dns records, which if 
compromised could be substantially harmful.

Cert Warden has a number of dns-01 options built-in, but the most common for users 
is likely to be the acme.sh method as it supports the most dns providers.

## Configuration

### Domains

You can add as many providers as you need. Each provider's configuration requires
a list of the domains the provider should be used for. If you only have one 
provider or if you have a provider that handles most domains, you can configure
one wildcard provider using a single domain of `*` which directs Cert Warden to use
the provider for all domains that aren't explicitly defined on another provider.

:::tip
Do not use wildcards here. The provider will be selected for all subdomains 
(including the wildcard subdomain) of the specified domains.

### Domain Aliases

:::tip
Domain Aliases are an advanced feature. You do not need to use domain alises to use
Cert Warden. In fact, most users probably won't use this feature.
:::

#### Background

In an effort to further secure an environment,
some folks do not like to grant API access for their primary domain to Cert Warden 
(or any other ACME client for that matter). Instead, the ACME Client is given API 
access to an alternate domain, perhaps even one with the sole purpose of ACME challenge
solving. The user then manually creates static CNAME records on the primary domain that
point at the alternate domain. This allows the ACME client to provision records to the
alternate domain automatically, which the ACME server will use for validation (via the
CNAME) without providing the ACME client with full access to the primary domain.

This function is the same as what acme.sh offers via DNS alias mode, which you can
read more about [here](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/DNS-alias-mode).

#### Usage

First, in Cert Warden, create a challenge provider for the alternate domain that Cert
Warden will provision text records on (e.g., `insecure-example.com`).

Second, manually login to your DNS Provider and create a CNAME record for each domain
or subdomain you want a certificate for (e.g., `_acme-challenge.myapp.example.com` CNAME 
`_acme-challenge.myapp.insecure-example.com`). You must include the `_acme-challenge`
portion of the name.

:::warning
Do NOT skip the Second step! If you do not manually create every CNAME record that you
need, validation will not succeed and you will not be able to acquire certificates.
:::

Third, under `Providers` -> `Domain Aliases` in Cert Warden, add the alias. Aliases
automatically include all subdomains, so you do not need to create an alias for every
subdomain you want a certificate for. For example, the alias in the image would alias
`_acme-challenge.example.com` to `_acme-challenge.insecure-example.com` as well as
aliasing `_acme-challenge.myapp.example.com` to `_acme-challenge.myapp.insecure-example.com`.

`Challenge Domain` is the domain you are acquiring certificates for. `Provision Domain`
is the domain Cert Warden will create DNS records on.

![Edit Account Page](/img/screenshots/domain_aliases.png)

In this example, Cert Warden will provision a TXT dns record on
`_acme-challenge.myapp.insecure-example.com` when a certificate has a domain name set
to `myapp.example.com`. When the ACME server tries to validate control of this domain,
it will encounter your manually create CNAME record when it queries
`_acme-challenge.myapp.example.com` and will the subsequently query the TXT record on
`_acme-challenge.myapp.insecure-example.com`.
