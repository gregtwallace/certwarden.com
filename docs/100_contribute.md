## Code, Docs, etc.

If you run into issues with code, documentation (including this site), etc.
please report them or even submit PRs to fix them. If you want to make a major
contribution (such as a feature request), do contact me first. I'd like to
ensure our goals align before you invest a significant amount of time in the
project.

Help is always welcome.
